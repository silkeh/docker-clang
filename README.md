# Clang / LLVM docker containers
[![docker](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/silkeh/clang.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/silkeh/clang/)

A collection of images containing official Clang/LLVM releases.
All Docker images are generated in GitLab CI, and can be found [here][artifacts].

The `latest` tag contains the latest stable LLVM version on the latest stable Debian version.
The `dev` tag contains a nightly build of the unstable branch from <https://apt.llvm.org/>.

Images can be pulled from [Docker Hub], [GitHub] and [GitLab].

The versions and contents of the Debian packages are generated based on [config.yaml][],
in which new versions of LLVM and Debian can be added.
